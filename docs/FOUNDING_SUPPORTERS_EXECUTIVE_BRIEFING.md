## Risk Factors

### 1. Over-Utilization Risk
- **Risk:** Founders use more API calls than projected
- **Mitigation:** Fair use policy, overage billing at reduced rates
- **Impact:** Margin compression, not loss

### 2. Affiliate Fraud Risk
- **Risk:** Self-referrals or fraudulent signups
- **Mitigation:** Identity verification, payout delays, manual review
- **Impact:** Increased payout ratio

### 3. Provider Cost Increases
- **Risk:** OpenAI/Anthropic raise API prices
- **Mitigation:** Multi-provider routing, model optimization
- **Impact:** Reduced margin on founder accounts

### 4. Low Conversion Risk
- **Risk:** Founders don't convert referrals
- **Mitigation:** This is actually positive (no affiliate payouts)
- **Impact:** Higher net revenue retention

### 5. Refund Risk
- **Risk:** High refund rate in first 14 days
- **Mitigation:** Strong onboarding, early engagement
- **Impact:** Reduced founder revenue

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Pre-Launch
- Waitlist signups
- Tier preference distribution
- Referral link shares

### Launch
- Conversion rate by tier
- Affiliate-driven vs. organic signups
- Geographic distribution

### Post-Launch
- API utilization rate
- Overage purchase frequency
- Churn/refund rate (14-day window)
- Affiliate payout ratio

---

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Gold Tier Marketing** - Best balance of volume and margin
2. **Limit Diamond to True VIPs** - High support cost, reserve for influencers
3. **Monitor Utilization Weekly** - Adjust projections as real data comes in
4. **Delay Affiliate Payouts 30 Days** - Protect against refund arbitrage
5. **Build Overage Upsell Flow** - Critical for long-term profitability
