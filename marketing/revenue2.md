**Document Owner:** C-Suite / Finance
**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents an alternative commission model that significantly reduces founder payouts while providing sustainable passive income through a round-robin distribution system.

### Key Changes from Original Model

| Aspect | Original Model | New Model V2 |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Founder Commission | 30-50% on referrals | 1-4% on ALL sales (passive) |
| Earning Type | Active (must refer) | Passive (round-robin pool) |
| Developer Affiliate | 30-50% (same as founders) | 25% on direct referrals |
| Commission Pool | Individual tracking | Shared pool by tier |
| Company Retention | ~65% | ~92% |

### Financial Impact Summary (Month 12 Projection)

| Metric | Original Model | New Model V2 | Difference |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| MRR | $37,895 | $37,895 | - |
| Operating Costs | $4,847 | $4,847 | - |
| Commission Payouts | $13,263 (35%) | $3,032 (8%) | -$10,231 |
| **Net Profit** | **$19,785** | **$30,016** | **+$10,231** |
| **Net Margin** | **52.2%** | **79.2%** | **+27%** |

## 2. Founder Tier Commission Structure

### Passive Round-Robin Rates

| Tier | Count | Commission Rate | Pool Share Weight |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Silver | 600 | 1% of all sales | 1x |
| Gold | 300 | 2% of all sales | 2x |
| Diamond | 100 | 3% of all sales | 3x |

### Weighted Pool Calculation

Total weight units = (600 × 1) + (300 × 2) + (100 × 3) = 600 + 600 + 300 = **1,500 units**

| Tier | Founders | Weight Each | Total Weight | % of Pool |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Silver | 600 | 1 | 600 | 40% |
| Gold | 300 | 2 | 600 | 40% |
| Diamond | 100 | 3 | 300 | 20% |
| **TOTAL** | **1,000** | - | **1,500** | 100% |

---

## 3. Round-Robin Distribution Mechanics

### How It Works

1. **All platform revenue** enters a commission pool
2. **Pool allocation**: Weighted by tier (1x, 2x, 3x)
3. **Distribution**: Divided equally among founders within each tier
4. **Frequency**: Monthly payouts (minimum $10 threshold)

### Commission Pool Rate

The founder commission pool is funded by a **blended rate** based on tier distribution:

```
Pool Rate = (Silver% × 1%) + (Gold% × 2%) + (Diamond% × 3%)
Pool Rate = (40% × 1%) + (40% × 2%) + (20% × 3%)
Pool Rate = 0.4% + 0.8% + 0.6% = 1.8% of all revenue
```

**Total Founder Commission Pool = 1.8% of MRR**

|--------|-------|
| **Commission Rate** | 25% of first payment |
| **Recurring** | None (first payment only) |

### Developer Affiliate vs Founder Comparison

| Aspect | Founder (Passive) | Developer Affiliate (Active) |

| Commission Rate | 1-3% (weighted) | 25% (first payment) |

2. **Predictable costs** - Fixed 1.8% founder pool vs variable 30-50%
3. **Sustainable passive income** - Founders earn without effort
4. **Clear value separation** - Passive (founders) vs Active (affiliates)
5. **Retention of capital** - More funds for growth and development
