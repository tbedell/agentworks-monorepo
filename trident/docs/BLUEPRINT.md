## Executive Summary

AgentWorks Trident transforms the $2.5 trillion professional services market by replacing human-powered business processes with AI-powered workflows. While the current AgentWorks platform enables "vibe coding" (AI builds software), Trident adds "Service-as-Software" (AI runs business operations).

**The Trident Promise**: Speed. Leverage. Precision.

## Vision Statement

> "Every business process that can be written as an SOP can be automated by an AI agent."

We envision a world where:
- A dentist clicks "Install Patient Recall Bot" and never misses a preventive care appointment
- An accountant deploys "Invoice Chaser" and reduces AR collection from 45 days to 7 days
- A contractor activates "Subcontractor Compliance" and never chases a lien waiver again

**The Trident Difference**: We don't sell software to build. We sell outcomes to achieve.

## The Three Prongs (Core Philosophy)

| Prong | Principle | Manifestation |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **VELOCITY** | Speed | Execute 100x faster than human reaction time. An invoice is sent in milliseconds, not days. |
| **LEVERAGE** | Efficiency | One manager directs 100 AI agents. The ratio flips from 1:5 to 1:100. |
| **PRECISION** | Accuracy | Deterministic SOP compliance. Zero missed steps. Zero human error. |

### Why "Trident"?

The trident solves the **Iron Triangle** of project management:
- Fast
- Good
- Cheap

Traditional wisdom says "pick two." Trident delivers all three because AI agents don't negotiate, don't tire, and don't make mistakes when given clear instructions.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Positioning | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Zapier | "Connect your apps" | No AI intelligence, just data piping |
| Make (Integromat) | Visual automation | Complex, requires technical knowledge |
| n8n | Self-hosted automation | Developer-focused, no business templates |
| Bardeen | Browser automation | Limited to web actions |
| Clay | Sales enrichment | Single-use case (sales) |

### Our Differentiation

1. **Industry-Specific Blueprints**: Pre-built workflows for each vertical
2. **AI-Native**: Agents make decisions, not just move data
3. **One-Click Deployment**: No coding, no configuration wizards

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Three Customer Segments

| Segment | Description | Price Point | Acquisition |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Founders** | Early believers, provide capital + evangelism | $497+ one-time | Waitlist, referral |
| **Developers** | Power users, provide feedback + usage | $49/mo | Content, SEO, community |
| **Agencies** | Resellers, provide distribution + trust | $297-$497/mo | Partner program, sales |

### The Agency Channel

Agencies are the **bridge** between raw AI technology and non-technical business owners.

**Problem**: A dentist won't buy "AI orchestration." They will buy "Never Miss a Patient Recall" from their trusted marketing agency.

**Solution**: AgentWorks AgencyOS
- White-label platform (agency branding)
- Unlimited sub-accounts ($497/mo flat fee)
- Insight Dashboard (KPIs, not terminal output)
- Client Operations Center (business stages, not dev stages)

**Agency Economics**:
- Agency pays: $497/mo
- Agency charges: $99-299/mo per client
- 10 clients = $1,000-$2,990/mo revenue
- **Profit margin: 50-83%**
