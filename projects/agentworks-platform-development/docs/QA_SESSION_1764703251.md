## Section 1: Project Vision

### Q1: Problem Statement
**What problem are you solving? Who are your users? What's the core value proposition?**

*[Human Response]:*

**Problem:** Technical founders and engineering teams struggle to efficiently leverage AI agents for software development projects while maintaining control, visibility, and cost management. Existing AI coding tools lack proper orchestration, multi-provider routing, usage tracking, and structured project management.

**Users:**
- Technical Founders: Need to ship products quickly with minimal headcount
- Staff/Lead Engineers: Want AI force-multipliers while maintaining architecture quality and control
- Platform/DevEx Engineers: Need to standardize AI agent usage across teams and track costs

**Core Value Proposition:** An agent-native Kanban platform that orchestrates multiple AI agents across a structured development pipeline (Lanes 0-10), providing complete visibility into AI usage, costs, and project progress while maintaining human control and approval at key stages.



### Q2: Market Context  
**What's your competitive landscape? How does this differ from existing solutions?**

*[Human Response]:*

**Competitive Landscape:**
- AI Coding Assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit Agent): Focus on individual coding but lack project orchestration
- Project Management Tools (Jira, Linear, Monday): Have Kanban but no AI integration or agent orchestration
- AI Development Platforms (v0.dev, Bolt): Generate code but lack structured workflow and cost management

**Key Differentiators:**
- Agent-native Kanban with structured 11-lane development pipeline (Vision → Deploy → Optimize)
- Multi-provider LLM routing (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Nano Banana) with transparent cost tracking
- Built-in usage tracking with 5x markup and $0.25 increments targeting 80% margin
- Complete audit trail via LLM terminal logs for every agent run
- Structured handoffs between specialized agents (CEO CoPilot → Strategy → PRD → Architect → Dev → QA)

## Section 2: Infrastructure Profile

### Q3: Technical Profile
**Based on your needs, here are three infrastructure options:**

**🌐 Standard SaaS**
- Web-only SaaS with auth, payments, and basic features
- *Choose This If:* Building a typical web application

**☁️ Next.js Cloud Run AlloyDB** 
- Full-stack SaaS with web and Expo mobile apps
- *Choose This If:* Need both web and mobile with advanced data

**🏢 Internal Tool**
- Internal business application with team management  
- *Choose This If:* Building for internal teams/workflows

**Which infrastructure profile fits your project?**

*[Human Response]:*

**☁️ Next.js Cloud Run AlloyDB** 

This fits best because we need:
- Full-stack SaaS with advanced data handling for multi-tenant workspaces
- Complex relational data (users, workspaces, projects, cards, agent runs, usage tracking)
- Real-time features (LLM terminal logs, WebSockets for live agent runs)
- Scalable microservices architecture on GCP (Cloud Run, AlloyDB/Postgres, Firestore, Pub/Sub)
- Advanced data querying for usage analytics and billing calculations
